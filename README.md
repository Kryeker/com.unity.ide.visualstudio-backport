## Versioning
Tags and UPM package versions will be postfixed `-apf` from 2.0.22 on.

Adaptions for previous versions are also available, see [tags](https://github.com/krisrok/com.unity.ide.visualstudio/tags).

## Usage

1. Navigate to Edit/Preferences/External Tools.
2. Use the the pre-existing filters to choose between embedded, local packages and so on. (Note this functionality is already provided by Unity's original package.)
3. Now, for finer-grained control you can open the the "Advanced Filters" foldout:
4. Select which packages and assemblies (defined by .asmdefs) you actually want in your solution. Tip: You can also use Ctrl/Shift to add/remove checkmarks in bulk while moving your cursor over them.
5. Click "Regenerate project files" to make sure changes are applied.
6. Open Visual Studio e.g. by opening a script. If the solution is already open Visual Studio should display a dialog to automatically re-open it.

## Note
This is a fork of a mirror package because Unity does not provide public access to the original sources.
